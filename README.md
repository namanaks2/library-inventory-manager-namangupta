# library-inventory-manager-namangupta
The Library Manager is a simple command-line application that helps campus libraries organize and track books using object-oriented Python. Users can add books, search by title or ISBN, and issue or return them while the system automatically updates each book’s availability status. The inventory is stored in a JSON file, allowing data to persist even after the program closes, and logging ensures errors and actions are recorded. With a clean menu-driven interface and modular design, the project is easy to use, maintain, and extend.
